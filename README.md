# Continuous Machine Learning with Kubeflow

This is the repository for [Continuous Machine Learning with Kubeflow
](https://bpbonline.com/products/continuous-machine-learning-with-kubeflow-1?_pos=1&_sid=4fe365093&_ss=r),published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book.
## About the Book
'Continuous Machine Learning with Kubeflow' introduces you to the modern machine learning infrastructure, which includes Kubernetes and the Kubeflow architecture. This book will explain the fundamentals of deploying various AI/ML use cases with TensorFlow training and serving with Kubernetes and how Kubernetes can help with specific projects from start to finish.

This book will help demonstrate how to use Kubeflow components, deploy them in GCP, and serve them in production using real-time data prediction. With Kubeflow KFserving, we'll look at serving techniques, build a computer vision-based user interface in streamlit, and then deploy it to the Google cloud platforms, Kubernetes and Heroku.  Next, we also explore how to build Explainable AI for determining fairness and biasness with a What-if tool. Backed with various use-cases, we will learn how to put machine learning into production, including training and serving. 

After reading this book, you will be able to build your ML projects in the cloud using Kubeflow and the latest technology. In addition, you will gain a solid knowledge of DevOps and MLOps, which will open doors to various job roles in companies.
